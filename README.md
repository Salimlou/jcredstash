# jcredstash
A pure Java implementation of the CredStash utility originally in Python

# About this version
This is  a fork of [Jesse Coyle version](https://github.com/jessecoyle/jcredstash).
I forked this repository because the author seems to not maintain it anymore.

My plan is to:
* Upgrade all dependencies.
* Clean up some parts of the code.
* Release the artifact on Maven Central

I'll happily take pull requests, comments and any help I can get :)
